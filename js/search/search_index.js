It is likely to have many changes over time,\nparticularly as all of the tools improve.\nGoals\n\nShow an example of a sprawling set of related Angular applications, divided\ninto various libraries.\nManage complexity, size, and scale.\nProvide a way to \"bloat up\" with numerous randomly generated additional\nmodules/features/components, up to the size of the largest Angular\napplications.\nInitially use Angular CLI and Nx.\nLater, Bazel.\n\nTechnologies used\n\nAngular 5\nAngular CLI\nNx\nNgRx/Store, Store addons\nRxJS\nLodash, Moment\nREST\nSSE\nGraphQL\n\nExplanation - how it works\nThis set of example applications features use Nx to wire up enter project\ndependencies during development. Following the Nx convention, they are divided\ninto \"apps\" and \"libs\".\nThere is a many-to-many relatioship between applications and modules, and\nmodules can use other modules.\nIn addition, there is a \"servers\" directory intended to contain one or more\nserver-side example code bases that support the Angular example. These are not\nmanaged using Nx, which is Angular specific. However, in a sprawling set of\nrelated servers and libraries, Lerna could be used too much the same effect.\nExample application\nThe example applications are not very complex - certainly not complex enough to\nwarrant the amount of complexity used to build it. Real application of this\nmodest complexity could easily be written as a single project (each).\nStill, the example applications reuse blocks of functionality, so they show the\nvalue of this multi-package approach.\nThere are three application to run:\n\nAdmin - bundles 5 feature modules\nAgent - bundles 2 feature module\nPortal - bundles 1 feature module\n\nTo understand how they are cross wired, look at the tsconfig.json file for each.\nTwo of the modules use ngrx/store for state management, With appropriate lazy\nloading of feature modules.\nRunning the example applications\nIn one window:\nyarn\nyarn start\n# add --app=agent or --app=portal if desiredIn another window:\ncd servers/node\nyarn\nyarn startContact us\nMain author: Kyle Cordes\nMuch help from the team at: Oasis
